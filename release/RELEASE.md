# Cutting a release



1. Run `scripts/release.sh`. This cuts a new release on PyPI. You
will have to have a PyPI account and have access to the epitome
project for this to work.

2. The release script will push a release branch to your repository.
Make a pull request to upstream from this branch.

3. Tag a release on github.
